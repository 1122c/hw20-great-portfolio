            <p>Blending my background in healthcare and software engineering, I've developed a nuanced approach to solving complex problems with precision and creativity. As a physical therapist assistant, I cultivated a keen eye for detail and patient-centered solutions, now informing my software development. My involvement in a genomic project enriched my expertise, particularly in data visualization, enabling me to effectively present complex data. I am eager to combine my unique mix of healthcare insights, software engineering skills, and data visualization experience from this project to create impactful web applications.</p>
